        Hi! I'm Thelma and I'm an engineer in Interactive Media Technology from KTH. I'm currently studying my last year of my master where I have a specialisation within Sound and Music Computing. My biggest interest is within sound/music, design, UX and tech. I would also like to add my other interests such as dogs, plants, sustainability, flue markets and movies. However, my biggest passion is still music. I started to play piano at the age of eight but have not a higher musical graduation than a high school graduation. Since high school graduation, I've volonteered as a piano teacher and been taking some small courses in film music and composition, as composition is something I like to do in my spare time. I love listen to film music and I find it very interesting to put sound on to something. I have therefore always had a dream to become a film music composer, but lately I have been more into becoming a sound designer. Putting sound into our life is like being a film music composer in its own movie. I believe that the knowledge I've got from KTH in technology, UX and design can be well put into new ways of exploring sound design or sound installations.
